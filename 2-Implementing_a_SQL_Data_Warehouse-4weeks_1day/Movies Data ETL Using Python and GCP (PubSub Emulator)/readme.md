# 🎥 ETL Movies Data Project

## **🚀 Project Overview**

Welcome to the ETL Movies Data Project! 🌟 This project is a deep dive into building an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python, Docker, and a Google Cloud Pub/Sub emulator. We’re working with a dataset of movie ratings, transforming it into a format that's ready for analysis, and loading it into a Docker container for easy access and management. This project is perfect for those looking to simulate a real-world ETL process in a local environment. 💻

## **📚 Project Steps**

Here’s a step-by-step guide to get you through the project:

### **1️⃣ Setup Environment**

**Goal:** Set up the project environment with all the necessary dependencies.

**How:** Run the `setup_env.bat` script, and let the automation magic happen! ✨

---

### **2️⃣ Download Data**

**Goal:** Get the movie ratings data.

**How:** Simply run `download_data.bat`, and the data will be at your service! 📥

---

### **3️⃣ Set Up Pub/Sub Emulator**

**Goal:** Simulate the Pub/Sub environment locally.

**How:** Kickstart the emulator with `start_emulator.py`. 🚀

---

### **4️⃣ Build Docker Image**

**Goal:** Package everything into a Docker image.

**How:** Build the image using Docker, and watch it come to life! 🛠

---

### **5️⃣ Run Docker Container**

**Goal:** Spin up the Docker container.

**How:** Use the Docker run command, and let the container do its thing. 🏃‍♂️

---

### **6️⃣ Create Pub/Sub Topic and Subscription**

**Goal:** Create a Pub/Sub topic and subscription.

**How:** Execute `create_topic_subscription.py`, and set the stage for data flow. 🌐

---

### **7️⃣ Test Data Ingestion**

**Goal:** Ensure data ingestion works smoothly.

**How:** Run `publish_test_message.py` and see the messages flow! 🎯

---

### **8️⃣ Extract CSV Files**

**Goal:** Extract and prepare the data.

**How:** Run `process_data.py` and get your CSVs ready for action! 📑

---

### **9️⃣ Preprocess Data**

**Goal:** Clean and prep the data.

**How:** Execute `preprocessing_data.py`, and your data will be spotless! 🧼
- inside this Python file:
  - null values have been filled
  - datatype correction
  - merge data depending on the item_id

---

### **🔟 Create Folder in Docker Container**

**Goal:** Create a place in the container for our data.

**How:** Access the Docker terminal and create the `/data` folder. 📂

---

### **1️⃣1️⃣ Publish Data to Container**

**Goal:** Send the data into the Docker container.

**How:** Run `publish_data.py` and watch the data transfer! 🚚

---

## **💡 Understanding Pub/Sub and Its Role**

Google Cloud Pub/Sub is all about handling data in real-time, and this project, allows us to simulate how large-scale data processing would work in the cloud. The Pub/Sub emulator lets us develop and test everything locally, so we’re ready for the real cloud when the time comes. ☁️

---

## **🚧 Challenges Faced**

- **Handling Big Data:** Processing 100,000 rows was a challenge, but we conquered it! 💪
- **Local Cloud Simulation:** Setting up the Pub/Sub emulator wasn’t easy, but it was worth it. 🎓
- **Data Cleaning:** Ensuring clean and reliable data required some serious attention to detail. 🧹
